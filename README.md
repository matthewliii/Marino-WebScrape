# Marino Facility Usage Tracker

This project was created to help optimize my schedule and eliminate excuses for skipping the gym. By visualizing when people use these facilities, Iâ€™ve been able to identify the best times to go and plan my schedule accordingly.

The app scrapes data from the Northeastern Campus Recreation Website every 30 minutes, which reports employee-provided data on the number of people at each facility. This information is then processed and presented in an intuitive, interactive format.

## Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: See usage trends across various gym facilities.
- **Data-Driven Scheduling**: Plan your gym visits during off-peak hours.
- **Fully Automated**: Data is automatically scraped and updated at regular intervals.
